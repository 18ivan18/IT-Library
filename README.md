    # How to?
    To run the project locally you need to have **npm** installed. Recommended versions are 
    `npm -v` 
    `6.14.10`
    `node -v` 
    `14.15.4`

    If you are missing **npm** check out https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm.
    
    First install the node modules with `npm i` and now you are all set up. Start the development server with the `npm run serve` command. The server will start at either port **[3000](http://localhost:3000/ "localhost:3000")** or env.PORT.
